# Automated Testing for Project, Task, and Timesheet Modules

## Overview

This document describes the automated tests implemented for the Project, Task, and Timesheet modules in the `staff` Django app. The tests cover model validations, view functionality, and API endpoints to ensure the correctness and reliability of these modules.

## Test Coverage

- **Model Tests**
  - Verify creation and field values for Project, Task, and Timesheet models.
  - Check relationships such as ManyToMany fields and ForeignKeys.

- **View Tests**
  - Test list views, detail views, and form views for Project, Task, and Timesheet.
  - Validate HTTP response status codes and presence of expected content.
  - Test GET requests for form rendering and list display.

- **API Tests**
  - Test API endpoints for fetching tasks by project and fetching project members.
  - Validate JSON response structure and status codes.

## Running the Tests

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed.
2. Run the Django test suite using the following command from the project root:

```bash
python manage.py test staff.tests
```

3. The test runner will execute all tests in `staff/tests.py` and report the results.

## Best Practices

- Tests are written using Django's `TestCase` class for database isolation.
- Test data is created in `setUp` methods to ensure independence.
- Use Django test client to simulate HTTP requests for views and APIs.
- Tests include assertions for response status, content, and database state.
- Keep tests small, focused, and descriptive for maintainability.

## Extending Tests

- Add tests for edge cases and error handling as needed.
- Include tests for permissions and authentication if applicable.
- Add integration tests for workflows involving multiple modules.
- Update tests when models or views change to maintain coverage.
